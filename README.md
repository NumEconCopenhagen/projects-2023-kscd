This repository contains a collection of projects completed by our group. Each project focuses on a specific topic and utilizes different analytical approaches. Below is an overview of the projects included in this repository.

## Project 1: Inaugural Project

In the inaugural project, we analyze an economic model that explores the optimal allocation of time and resources between market work and home production for households. By considering factors such as wages, preferences, and production technologies, we aim to understand the disparities between male and female workers and their impact on household utility. The project includes code implementations, analysis, and visualizations.

The project files can be found in the [InauguralProject](InauguralProject) folder.

## Project 2: Data Project

The data project focuses on fetching and analyzing data from a specific source (Source X) on a particular topic (Y). We delve into the data, identifying patterns, trends, and insights that can inform decision-making or support research in the given domain. The project showcases our data retrieval process, data manipulation techniques, and visualization skills.

The project files can be found in the [DataProject](DataProject) folder.

## Project 3: Model Project

The model project involves the development and analysis of a specific model (or models) to address a particular problem or research question. The project showcases our modeling techniques, optimization approaches, and interpretation of results. The project aims to provide insights and solutions to real-world challenges using mathematical or computational modeling.

The project files can be found in the [ModelProject](ModelProject) folder.

## Project 4: Exam Project

The exam project consists of three problems that we have solved. Each problem is described in detail, and the solutions are provided in Python code. The project files can be found in the [ExamProject](ExamProject) folder.
