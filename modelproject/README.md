# Model Analysis Project

Our project is titled **Cobb-Douglas Production Function Analysis** and aims to explore the Cobb-Douglas production function, a widely used economic model for analyzing the relationship between inputs and output in a production process.

## Project Description

In this project, we analyze both the baseline and extended versions of the Cobb-Douglas production function. The baseline model considers the fundamental parameters of capital, labor, and their respective shares in production, while the extended model incorporates additional factors such as technology and elasticity of output.

We investigate various aspects of the models, including the calculation of output, cost, and marginal product of capital and labor. Additionally, we explore the optimization of capital and labor inputs to achieve specific output targets while considering cost constraints.

## Dependencies

The project has the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- Standard Anaconda distribution

No additional packages are required beyond a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation.

## Results

The project's results, including the analysis of the baseline and extended models, can be found by running the [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb) notebook. The notebook provides a detailed explanation of the models, their calculations, and the optimization process. It also presents visualizations and comparisons of the model outputs.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the Cobb-Douglas production function in this project sheds light on the relationship between inputs and output in a production process. By considering different factors and parameters, we gain insights into the efficiency of resource allocation and the impact of technology on production.

The project serves as a foundation for further exploration and application of the Cobb-Douglas production function in real-world scenarios. It highlights the importance of considering additional factors and factors beyond capital and labor to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the production process.
