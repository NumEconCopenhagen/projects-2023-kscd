# Inaugural Project

Our project is titled **Household Specialization Model** and aims to analyze the optimal allocation of time and resources between market work and home production for households.

## Project Description

The Household Specialization Model explores the decision-making process of households in allocating their time and resources between market work and home production. By considering various factors such as preferences, production technologies, and wage rates, the model determines the optimal allocation that maximizes household utility.

The project provides both discrete and continuous solutions to the model. The discrete solution calculates the utility for all possible combinations of time allocation, while the continuous solution utilizes optimization techniques to find the optimal allocation under given constraints. Additionally, the model incorporates a regression analysis to estimate the relationship between female wages and home production.
