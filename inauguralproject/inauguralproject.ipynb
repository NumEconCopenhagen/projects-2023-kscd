    "We want to see how different values for $\\alpha$ and $\\sigma$ effect the home production ratio between male and female, therefore it would make sense to graph this, so we have a visual image of how the ratio changes based on changes to $\\alpha$ and/or $\\sigma$. There are two ways to display this, one way would be to display this as a graph with 3 axes and another would be to display this as a line graph with 2 axes, where different lines represent different values of $\\alpha$. In this case we choose to do the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we can do the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define 2 lists for each value of $\\alpha$ and $\\sigma$, and also define 2 empty lists for $H_M$ and $H_M$. \n",
    "2. Creating a for loop to solve the function for each value of $\\alpha$ and $\\sigma$, and storing it into the before mentioned empty lists.\n",
    "3. Define a function to calculate the ratio of $\\frac{H_F}{H_M}$.\n",
    "4. Reshape the results into a matrix for $\\frac{H_F}{H_M}$.\n",
    "5. Create a for loop to calculate for each comination of $\\alpha$ and $\\sigma$.\n",
    "6. Plot everything as line graph, where each line represents a value for $\\alpha$. Here the x-axis will be $\\sigma$ and the y-axis the $\\frac{H_F}{H_M}$ ratio."
