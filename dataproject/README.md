# Data analysis Project - Gender Disparities in Employment and Unemployment Across Danish Industries
---
This project analyzes the gross unemployment rate in Denmark across industries to identify patterns and trends in the labor market. We explore the gender gap in unemployment rates across different industries and visualize our findings using interactive plots. The project is presented as a "story" to provide a more reader-friendly flow.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb].

## Applied Datasets
