# Exam Project

This repository contains the solutions for an exam project consisting of three problems. Each problem is described in detail, and the solutions are provided in Python code.

## Files

- [Exam-2023-notebook.ipynb](Exam-2023-notebook.ipynb): The Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the project.
- [README.md](README.md): The project's README file.

## Dependencies

The project has the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- Standard Anaconda distribution

No additional packages are required beyond a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation.

## Problem 1: Optimal taxation with government consumption
The first problem deals with the optimization of labor supply and taxation in the presence of government consumption. The optimal labor supply choice and its dependence on various parameters are analyzed. Additionally, the socially optimal tax rate maximizing worker utility is determined. The code is provided to calculate the optimal labor supply choice and plot relevant graphs.

## Problem 2: Labor adjustment costs
The second problem involves a hair salon business and focuses on labor adjustment costs. The optimal policy for hiring hairdressers is explored, considering demand shocks and profitability. The code is provided to calculate optimal policies and determine their impact on profitability.

## Problem 3: Global optimizer with refined multi-start
The third problem revolves around the Griewank function, a mathematical optimization problem with local and global minima. A refined global optimizer with multi-start is implemented to find the global minimum of the function. The code is provided to perform the optimization and visualize the effective initial guesses during iterations.

Answers to each problem and the small questions for each are listed in [Exam-2023-notebook.ipynb](Exam-2023-notebook.ipynb)
